Description: `gbtransparency` is an R package for working with Green Bond Datasets. 
    There are five (5) datasets namely;  
    (1) bond's general information, 
    (2) allocation of proceeds to project categories using international standards (GBP, CBI),
    (3) measurements of impact and outcome KPIs,
    (4) individual bond-tranche information and 
    (5) detailed information of the projects receiving disbursements. 
    `gbtransparency` therefore, provides an easy way for R users to load the datasets and 
    helper functions to ease common analysis workflows.
